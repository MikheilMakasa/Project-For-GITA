              The territory of Tbilisi has been inhabited since the Early Bronze
              Age (IV millennium BC). In the sources it is first mentioned in
              the second half of the IV century. By the end of the IV century,
              Tbilisi had become the residence of the Persian servant -
              Pitiakhsh. By the middle of the V century it was again in the
              hands of the kings of Kartli. In the V century, the city was
              restored and rebuilt by Vakhtang Gorgasali, according to some
              scientists, this is why he was considered to be the founder of the
              city. The oldest population of Tbilisi appeared in the district of
              the sulfur springs. The second district of Tbilisi also emerged in
              the IV century and in a later period it gradually grew upstream of
              the Mtkvari. Due to its convenient geographical location, Tbilisi
              has become one of the important centers of the Middle East. There
              were significant trade routes to East Transcaucasia and pre-Asia.
              By the end of the VI century it had become the object of
              centuries-long struggle, dispersal, and conquest. David IV
              Aghmashenebeli (the Builder) liberated the city of Tbilisi from
              the domination of foreigners in 1122. At this period Tbilisi
              became the state capital. From the XIII century the period of
              struggle and rebellion for Tbilisi begins again. In 1490, after
              the disintegration of Georgia into separate
              kingdoms-principalities, Tbilisi became only the political and
              administrative center of the Kingdom of Kartli. Since 1633, when
              Rostom was appointed governor of Kartli, Tbilisi was revived
              again. In 1735, Tbilisi was conquered by Nader Shah and in 1748,
              Erekle II liberated it. After that, the city regained strength,
              founded a philosophy seminar, there were arsenal, mint,
              earthenware enterprises and dye-houses of textile. Nowadays,
              Tbilisi is the capital of Georgia and one of the municipalities.

              Tbilisi is located in Eastern Georgia, in the Tbilisi Basin, on
              both banks of the river Mtkvari. It borders to the north by the
              foothills of Saguramo Ridge, to the east by the northwestern part
              of the Iori Plateau, and to the west by the branches of Trialeti
              Ridge. Administratively Tbilisi is divided into Gldani, Didube,
              Vake, Isani, Krtsanisi, Mtatsminda, Nadzaladevi, Saburtalo,
              Samgori and Chugureti districts. The main artery of the city water
              is the river Mtkvari. In the past, the basin of Tbilisi was
              covered by oak and hornbeam forests, but in the vicinity of
              Tbilisi forests have long been cut down and now, as part of the
              settled city, and neighboring plains, hills and mountain slopes
              occupied by paliurus of wood, stepped verdure and artificially
              built plants. According to general signs, the climate of Tbilisi
              is subtropical and semidry. Here it is hot summer and cold winter.
              The average air temperature in July is + 24.4, and in January it
              is + 0.9 °C. Sulphuretted hydrogen thermal water flows into many
              places in the old districts of Tbilisi. It is an important mineral
              of the city.

              <span class="strong">Samegrelo</span>
              - is a historical - geographical side of western Georgia that
              covers the territories between the rivers Rioni, Tskhenistskali,
              Enguri and the Black Sea. Its central city is Zugdidi. The
              Samegrelo region had a great strategic importance throughout its
              history, because of this, it became the object of numerous
              invasions by armies of the Romans, Byzantines, Mongols, Turks,
              Persians, Russians and others. This region is rich in cultural
              monuments of different eras and impressive nature, blue lakes and
              very beautiful canyons.

            <li>
              In ancient times, Samegrelo was a part of the Kingdom of Colchis.
              Colchis completely covered the territory of present-day western
              part of Georgia. Prior to the modern era, the region was also
              known as Lazika and Egrisi. Its political center was Archeopolis
              (or Nokalakevi). The myth of the Argonauts and the Golden Fleece
              is related to Nokalakevi. The Romans conquered this area in the
              first century BC and ruled it for almost 400 years. In the XI
              century, the western and eastern Georgia were united into one
              kingdom, which existed until the XI century. By the end of the XI
              century, Georgia was divided into three independent states:
              Kartli, Kakheti and Imereti. Several principalities were created,
              one of which was Odishi. It covered the whole territory of
              present-day Samegrelo. From the middle of the XII century through
              the XIX century, Odishi was ruled by the representatives of the
              Dadiani family. In 1803, Odishi became a protectorate of Russia.
              By this time the eastern Georgia was already under the Russian
              rule. In 1918, Georgia declared independence and Samegrelo became
              a part of the new democratic country. Today the territory of the
              principality of historic Samegrelo is part of Samegrelo-Zemo
              Svaneti administrative region.

            <li>
              Samegrelo is a very interesting place with its historical past and
              customs. The interest in the mode of life of this region was great
              in the past. Greek writers considered Colchis the descendants of
              the biblical son of Noah - Yaphet and Herodotus regarded them as a
              people of Egyptian descent. Nicolaus of Damascus wrote that the
              Colchians did not bury the dead in the ground, but they wrapped
              them up in the leather and hung on the tree. According to
              Herodotus, the custom of the Colchians was circumcision.
              Neighboring cultures had a big influence on such customs. Along
              with religious cultures from outside, worship of trees and others
              were spread in Colchis, part of which is still preserved in
              Samegrelo, mostly in the high mountain villages. One of the
              traditions is the “share of the crow”, in which the eggshell is
              filled with Ghomi and cheese, then they throw it up on the roof
              with the words: “share of the crow”, after which the crow will not
              take away the chickens. In all parts of Georgia the ritual of
              weeping was very important. In this respect, the well-known
              tradition is the Megrelian “Zari”- a ritual song for the weeping
              of the dead. Samegrelo is also rich in Folklor. The most famous
              Megrelian folk song is “Megrelian Nana”- the lullaby, one of which
              tunes were used by the Russian composer Peter Tchaikovsky in his
              famous Christmas ballet - The Nutcracker.

              <span class="strong">Svaneti</span>
              - is the highest mountainous, historical and geographical region
              in Georgia and is located in the Northern part of Western Georgia.
              Svaneti is distinguished by acute expression of individualism. The
              mountain picks, the cliffs, the fortress-towers, which have become
              symbols of freedom and a strong soul, have attracted the attention
              of travelers, tourists and fans of mountain sports. This ancient
              culture is very interesting with numerous cultural monuments,
              characteristic frescoes, traditions and impressive nature.

              The earliest mention about Svans occurs in Greek and Roman
              historians, Strabon (64/23 BC, 23/24)) and Plinius (23/24).
              According to Strabon, the Svans in the 1st century were stronger
              from the neighbouring tribes of the Dioscuri Highland.The Svans
              originally were settled in a more extensive area, and they held a
              significant part of Lechkhumi and Racha. Svans also lived in
              certain territories of present-day Samegrelo. In the early
              centuries Svaneti was part of Colchis and then Egrisi Kingdoms. In
              the first half of the III century BC, during the reign of King
              Parnavaz, Svaneti was the Saeristavo of the Kingdom of Kartli. In
              the IV century it became an ally of the Kingdom of Lazeti and
              often participated in the battles to protect the borders of the
              kingdom. Svaneti was always independent until 1833, when it was
              subordinated to Russia. In 1875-76 there was an uprising against
              the policy of tsarism (when the government of the king was going
              to increase taxes in the region) which ended with the destruction
              of the village of Khalde and capture of the rebels.The famous Svan
              song "Gaulgavkhe" was dedicated to the uprising in Svaneti.
              Nowadays, Svaneti is part of the administrative Regions of
              Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti and Racha-Lechkhumi-Kvemo Svaneti.

              Svaneti is a region with an ancient and interesting culture. Here,
              as in the whole mountainous regions of Georgia, pagan and
              Christian rituals, customs and traditions merge into each other
              and get a new, unique look. In Svaneti, there are still preserved
              centuries-old public holidays. One of the most beautiful holidays
              is “Lamproba”, which is still preserved only in Svaneti. This
              festival is held in the pre-spring period, for good weather and
              harvest. The main attribute of this holiday are lamps made of
              wood. After the rituals, accompanied by lamps, people gather
              around the fire and singing, dancing around, wrestling, etc. In
              Svaneti people are celebrating Uplish (Kviratskhovloba) with a
              great triumph, also the great holiday is Kvirikoba, which is
              celebrated in the Church of St. Kvirike and Ivlita in Kalas (the
              same as Lagurka). The celebration of the souls of the dead,
              Lipanali, is also well-known, etc. It is worth noting Svan
              folklore with dances, highly artistic poetry and singing. The Svan
              Lile is well-known, which is dedicated to the god of the sun. In
              Svaneti there are a lot of myths about goddesses, demons, magical
              creatures, also you will hear unbelievable hunting stories. An
              indivisible accessory of Svan clothing is the Svan hat made of
              felt. The twisted thread stretched over it creates a cross on the
              top. Svan cuisine is special and delicious. In ancient times, the
              Svan Supra (feast) was considered a symbol of getting closer and
              respect. The reconciliation of deadly enemy were held at Supra,
              also agricultural and secular affairs were resolved there. Special
              dishes are Kubdari and Chvishtari. Because Svaneti is particularly
              developed in livestock, the cuisine is distinguished by the
              diversity of meat dishes and dairy products. Svans drinks vodka-
              Rakhi. From spices Svan Salt is well-known. Since ancient times,
              gold has been mined in Svaneti. In Legends, gold-horned bulls and
              a Golden-haired goddess are often found.

              <span class="strong">Imereti</span>
              - region is located in western Georgia and includes the territory
              of Imereti, a historical-geographical province. Imereti is a
              region with an ancient culture. It is also stunning and diverse in
              nature. Remains of the glory of ancient Colchis, temples,
              waterfalls, mystical Khvamli mountain, or numerous caves will take
              you on a journey into the magical world.
            </li>

            <li>
              Traces of human life in the territory of Imereti are yet confirmed
              from the Lower Paleolithic period (Paleolithic - from ancient
              times to 12000 BC). In the XIII century B.C. there was a large
              union of Colchian tribes here. Later, the former class Georgian
              state, Kolkata, was created. After the fall of Colchis, the
              kingdom of Colchis emerged in western Georgia, the capital of
              which, according to ancient authors, is considered to be Kutaisi.
              The territory of present-day Imereti was an integral part of the
              Kingdom of Colchis. In the 1st century, a new Georgian state unit,
              the Kingdom of Egrisi (Lazika), emerged on the site of the Kingdom
              of Colchis, which soon came under the influence of the Roman
              Empire. The kingdom of Egrisi was also the object of confrontation
              between the Greeks and the Persians. At the beginning of the 13th
              century, an Arab commander, Marwan ibn Muhammad (Marwan's cruelty
              and ruthlessness were epitomized by the Georgians by naming him
              Murvan Qru ("Marwan the Deaf")) invaded and dispersed in Egri. In
              the following period, Imereti became the center of Georgian life
              and Kutaisi became the capital of western Georgia first and then
              of Georgia. X-XII centuries are considered to be the golden age of
              Imereti. Important notes of Georgian culture were built during
              this period. In the XV century, after the collapse of the Georgian
              feudal monarchy, Imereti was established as a separate feudal
              state. Initially, the Kingdom of Imereti covered the entire
              territory of western Georgia, but in time it was separated from
              the principalities of Odisha, Guria, Abkhazia, and Svaneti. The
              capital of the Kingdom of Imereti was Kutaisi. Kutaisi has
              experienced many ups and downs, although it has often been raided
              due to its wealth and strategic location. Kutaisi has been a
              cultural and educational center for centuries. During the Soviet
              period, it was one of the largest industrial centers. Based on the
              current regional division, historical Imereti has the status of a
              territorial-administrative part.
            </li>

            <li>
              The culture of Imereti, like other parts of Georgia, is different
              and diverse. Imereti celebrates various public holidays, such as
              Zekaroba, Ortsipoba (same as Motsametoba), Bosloba, Sachkherloba,
              Chiaturoba, etc. Bosloba is held in honor of the deity Boseli. On
              this holiday, the men going to Boseli (cowhouse) had children
              hanging on their backs, putting a piece of fat on the cattle - so
              to fatten. On Zekaroba people visit Kvasakdara hill, it is
              possible to taste traditional dishes, observe horse racing, and
              attend other events. The festival with this name has been held for
              several years and it is a new continuation of "Shepherd's Day".
              Singing is an integral part of Imereti. The folklore and folk
              songs of this region are well known. Imereti people are
              distinguished by their aesthetics and sobriety, which can be seen
              by their homestead and traditional clothing. You can also find
              samples of traditional beautiful clothes of Imereti in the
              Georgian National Museum. In ancient times, short chokha (Georgian
              national suit) was typical for Imereti. Raphael Eristavi (Georgian
              poet and playwright) described the Imereti man's attire as
              follows: "The Imereti people wore short chokha above Akhalukh,
              woolen shawls around their legs, which were tied with a special
              belt and a hat called Papanaki on their heads." Later, the
              Circassian long-style Chokha spread. This region is also
              distinguished by its construction skills. Here the tradition of
              homestead planning was passed down from generation to generation.
              The house stands in the center of the yard. It is tiled and
              decorated with carved balconies facing the sun. One of the oldest
              centers of pottery in Georgia is in Shrosha. The tradition and
              secret of the craft-making are preserved in every family here and
              is passed down from father to son. There is a big pottery market
              in the village of Shrosha. Imereti people are amazingly hospitable
              and Imereti cuisine is also incredibly delicious. Walnut dishes
              are common here, and herbs are also abundantly used. Imereti
              khachapuri is known and popular all over Georgia. Also one of the
              outstanding dishes is the fried chicken dipped in blackberry and
              unripe grape juice, so-called Isrimakvali. Imereti should also be
              mentioned in terms of winemaking. Imereti is one of the most
              diverse parts of Georgian wine, which is due to the diversity of
              climatic conditions and soil composition of mountainous Imereti.
              Imereti vine varieties are Tsolikauri, Tsitska, Krakhuna,
              Otskhanuri Sapere, Adanasuri, and others.

              <span class="strong">Kakheti</span>
              - is a region located in eastern Georgia, which includes the
              territories of the historical-geographical provinces of Kakheti,
              Hereti (partly), and Tusheti. This region is rich in monuments of
              different periods and diverse nature. Here you will find ancient
              settlements, distinctive temples, castle towers, beautiful
              forests, waterfalls, alpine lakes, vast plains, and even a radiant

              and resorts make Kakheti very attractive for those who want a
              pleasant vacation and for travel lovers.
            </li>

            <li>
              Traces of human life in Kakheti date back to the Stone Age.
              According to the discovered material, people lived permanently in
              the Stone Age on the territory of Kakheti. Traces of human life
              here must be defined between 2 million 300 thousand years and
              10,000 years BC. In the II and III millennia of the IV millennium
              BC (Early Bronze Age) the Mtkvari-Araksi culture was widespread on
              the territory of Kakheti, as well as in the whole central part of
              the South Caucasus. Kakheti was one of the main places for the
              spread of Trialeti culture in the Middle Bronze Age. The
              establishment of Kakheti as a separate territorial unit is
              attributed to Kakhos, one of the sons of the Georgian ethnarch,
              Kartlos. In ancient times, Kakheti covered a much smaller area,
              namely Ertso-Tianeti and Pkhovi, the center of which was Cheleti
              (Zhaleti). After Kartlos's wife redistributed the territory of
              Kartli to her sons, Kakho received the above-mentioned borders.
              But during the same Kakhos period, he ceded to his brother Kukhos
              the left bank of the Iori River from Lapiankhevi to Bochorma
              Fortress. From the 4th century, the center of Kakheti was Ujarma,
              built by King Asfarug. The borders of Kakheti were expanded in the
              east. By the VIII century, it covered an important part of Kukheti
              and Hereti. In the 11th century, the city of Telavi became the
              center of the region. In the XV century, after the disintegration
              of Georgia, the Kingdom of Kakheti was formed. From that time, the
              center of Kakheti became Gremi. In the XVI-XVII centuries, Kakheti
              was separated from the north-eastern part, which today bears the
              name of Saingilo and is administratively included in Azerbaijan.
              In the second half of the 17th century, the center of Kakheti
              moved to Telavi again. The Kingdom of Kakheti existed until the
              XIX century. Based on the current regional division, historical
              Kakheti has the status of a territorial-administrative side.

              Kakheti is an interesting place in terms of its culture and
              customs. Kakhetian folklore is noteworthy. Khakhetian folk songs
              Mravalzhamieri, Tsintskaro, Urmuli, Makruli, and others and
              well-known. "Chakrulo" was introduced to the world. As it is well
              known this important sample of Georgian folklore was sent into
              space. Tush folklore is also a part of the diversity of Kakheti
              region. Many public or religious holidays are celebrated in
              Kakheti, such as Alaverdoba, Iliaoba, Gremkalakoba, Erekleoba,
              Pirosmanoba, and others. Alaverdoba is an ancient holiday. It
              consisted of separate remarkable holidays, starting from the day
              after the Feast of the Cross ( Jvartamagleba ) and lasting three
              weeks. This holiday is also associated with some pre-Christian
              beliefs. During the holiday a market and several events were held
              in Alaverdi, people from different angles and faiths visited the
              Alaverdi temple. The celebration had its specific ritual ending.
              200-300 horsemen used to gather in the Alaverdi yard and surround
              the Alaverdi temple while singing "Dalai" (Georgian folk funeral
              poem-song) for the souls of those killed in the war. Tush holidays
              should also be noted, during which you will be able to taste the
              delicious traditional cuisine and get acquainted with interesting
              traditions. As for the clothing, the Kakhetian Chokha is long,
              with the knees bent, with a wedge-shaped opening around the chest
              to make the Akhalukh appear. It was worn largely unbuttoned, the
              sleeves extended to the wrist, and often worn rolled up. Georgian,
              Dagestani, and Ossetian shawls were used to sew Chokhi, mainly
              black, chestnut-colored, and blue. Tush embroidered clothes with
              colorful ornaments are undoubtedly uniquely beautiful. Kakheti is
              also known for its exceptional cuisine. Meat dishes are especially
              popular here. Traditional dishes are Mtsvadi (barbecue) fried on
              tsalami, khashlama, chakafuli, chikhirtma, and others. In Tusheti,
              dairy products and related dishes are common with meat. Tush
              cuisine is famous for Khinkali, Mtsvadi, Choban (Shepherd Kaurma),
              Khmiadi (ritual triangular bread), Gordila, Kumeli, Kotori,
              Khavitsi, Mosmula, and others. Tushuri Gudi cheese is well known,
              the cheese is made in a sheepskin bag. Different types of tea are
              also common here. It is impossible to talk about Kakhetian cuisine
              and not be reminded of Kakhetian wine. Kakheti is a wine country,
              it occupies a special place in the production of Georgian wine.

              upper Kartli, Meskheti. It was mentioned in Georgian written
              series firstly in XI century, in the narration of Leonti Mroveli,
              particularly in the notion of the division of Iberia into
              Saeristavo by King Pharnavaz( BC IV-III). But according to the
              scientists, the site was populated even in IV-III century BC, by
              the period of Stone Age. Bronze and Iron Age cultural layers have
              been found in the territory of Adjara. The story of Christianity
              is also connected with this region, Andrea the First preached
              Christianity in Adjara for the first time. Adjara was under the
              control of Gurieli in XV-XVI century, in XVII century Ottomans
              conquered it. In 1609 it was released and joined to the
              Principality of Guria, but soon in 1614 the region fell under the
              Ottomans, which lasted for two centuries. The population of Adjara
              was converted to Islam during the period of Ottoman domination,
              but people maintained Georgian nationality, the Georgian language,
              Georgian surnames and the most important, Georgian identity. After
              the Russian-Ottoman war, on the basis of a cease-fire agreement,
              Adjara became a part of the Russian Empire in 1878. After joining
              the Soviet Union, Adjara was declared an autonomous Soviet
              Socialist Republic in 1921 and after the restoration of Georgia's
              independence, it maintained the political status of the Autonomous
              Republic of Adjara.

              Racha is a region with a great history. The traces of human life
              was evidenced here in the Bronze Age. In the early period, Racha
              and Lechkhumi together created a Takveri( historical site).
              Takveri is mentioned in the 7th-century sources. Takveri was
              separated from Racha and Lechkhumi maintained the name. At the end
              of the 10th century, Racha Saeristavo ( territorial unit of
              medieval Georgia, Duchy) was set up, the first Eristavi( duke) of
              it was Rati Bakhvashi. In XII century David Narin abolished the
              Saeristavo, declared the area as a royal land. The Kakhaberidze
              ancestry has disappeared. In the XIV century, after the
              restoration of Sariavisto, Charelidze family had the title of
              Eristavi and later, in 1488, the family of Chkhetidze. In the
              second half of the 15th century, after the collapse of Georgia as
              a kingdom, Racha became the part of Samegrelo. In the XV century,
              the King of Imereti Bagrat III handed over Minda fortress to the
              dukes of Racha.In the XV-XVII centuries, the kings of Imereti
              owned slave land in Racha Saeristo. In 1789, Solomon II reigned in
              Imereti, who finally abolished the Racha Saeristavo. When the
              Imereti Kingdom became the part of the Russian Empire, the
              territory of Racha formed firstly Okrug( the unit of
              administrative autonomy of soviet union), then Mazra(
              administrative-territorial unit). Racha was ruled by several
              aristocrat families during different periods: Tsulukidze,
              Iashvili, Japaridze, Inasaridze, Lashkhishvili. Nowadays Racha is
              part of Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti region.

              explorers mentioned it. Famous Rachuli songs are "Kvedvrula",
              "Rashovda", "High in the mountains" and so on. The folk poetry of
              Racha is also preserved. There are a lot of legends about the
              establishment of villages and the etymology of their names. Racha
              is famous for carpentry. In many parts of Georgia, you can find

              <span class="strong">Lechkhumi</span>
              - is located in the northern part of western Georgia, present-day
              Tsageri municipality. It is distinguished by its ancient culture
              and beautiful nature. Lechkhumi is a very interesting and
              attractive place for travelers with forests, waterfalls, canyons,
              mineral waters, alpine meadows, lakes and a mystical mountain of
              Khvamli with a great history. Khvamli Mountain is an important
              place for the whole history of Georgia, which is visited by many
              people on the holiday of Khvamloba.
            </li>

            <li>
              The traces of human life in Lechkhumi date back to the
              Paleolithic-Neolithic age. The territory is considered as one of
              the most powerful metallurgical sites of the Late Bronze and Early
              Iron Age. From ancient times the international caravan route has
              been passing through the middle of Lechkhumi, connecting Fazisi
              with the peoples of the North Caucasus. After the creation of a
              united feudal state, the Kingdom of Georgia, the Takveri
              Saeristavo was created, which included present-day Racha -
              Lechkhumi and the part of Kvemo Svaneti. Its center was Tsageri.
              After the period of David the Builder, until the collapse of the
              united Georgian kingdom, Takveri was sometimes an independent
              Saeristavo and sometimes it was subordinate to Svaneti. Although,
              Lechkhumi was the smallest political entity in western Georgia,
              there were plenty of fortresses and it was a great shelter during
              the war. According to historical sources, the treasure storage of
              Georgian kings were on the Khvamli Mountain. Since the second half
              of the XVII century Lechkhumi was seeking for independence and a
              position appeared- the title of head of Lechkhumi. In the XII-XIV
              century Takveri was replaced by Lechkhumi. The word Lechkhumi is
              first mentioned at the end of the XV century. Its trade and
              economic center was in Lailashi. After the creation of the Kingdom
              of Imereti (XV century), Lechkhumi entered in the kingdom as a
              Royal Domain. From the second half of the XVII century, the
              Lechkhumian nobles tried to create separate Satavados. In 1714,
              after the Lechkhumi's dirigeant Bejan I Dadiani became the Mtavari
              of Samegrelo, Lechkhumi became one of the parts of the Samegrelo
              Principality, and was ruled by Dadiani's selected commander.
              Lechkhumi played a major role in the economy and military affairs
              of Odishi. Nowadays, historical Lechkhumi, present-day Tsageri
              Municipality, is the part of the Racha - Lechkhumi - Kvemo Svaneti
              region.

            <li>
              The traces of human life in Guria are evidenced from the Lower
              Paleolithic period. The process of consistent development of
              cultures continues throughout the Bronze Age and after that too.
              The material discoveries in Ureki-Tsvermaghala show the
              strengthening of the kingdom of Colkha and iron production in
              western Georgia (half of II millennium BC - I half of I millennium
              BC). In the VI century, the successor of Kolkha kingdom, Egrisi
              was developed in western Georgia. Guria was included in this
              territory too. After the collapse of Lazika, the territory between
              Rioni and Chorokhi was given to Guria. This site was less
              populated, but Guria progressed with the feudalization of the
              country. Guria mainly became strong in the VII-VIII centuries. The
              period is also relates to the strengthening of church and
              monastery life here. Firstly, Guria was mentioned with this name
              in the VIII century. In the feudal period, this region was
              established as one of the Saeristavo of Georgia( A territorial
              unit of Georgia, usually mentioned as a Duchy in English).
              Eristavi (Georgian equivalent of a duke or feudal lord) were
              Gurians, who came from the Vardanidze family. One of the first
              Eristavi of Guria must be Simon I Gureili. In the second half of
              the 15th century, after the collapse of united Georgia, Guria
              Samtavro (principality) emerged and was ruled by the Gurian
              people. The Guria principality was fighting constantly with the
              Kingdom of Imereti and the Ottoman Empire. Its principal ally was
              the Odishi principality. The independence of Guria's principality
              dates back to the time of Kakhaber II Gureli, when he opposed
              George VIII, the last king of united Georgia. From the second half
              of the XVII century, the Ottoman sultan asserted Gurieli on the
              throne. In the 1670s, Guria must give the tribute to Ottomans with
              56 girls and boys aged 10-20. In the middle of the XVIII century,
              Guria principality was consolidated under Mamia IV Gureli's
              government. He tried to expel the Ottomans with the help of Erekle
              II. Guria's principality existed until the middle of the 19th
              century. In 1877-1878 Russian-Ottoman war front went on in Guria,
              which really damaged the region. On the basis of today's regional
              divisions, historical Guria has the status of a
              territorial-administrative region.

              Guria is a very interesting region with its culture, customs and

              - is located in eastern Georgia, which covers the territories of
              Kvemo Kartli and Trialeti. This area has a long history starting
              from prehistoric times to nowadays. The first Europeans of
              1,800,000 years were discovered in Kvemo Kartli, named Zezva and
              Mzia. The Golden Mill of Sakdrisi from the IV Millennium is also
              here. Kvemo Kartli is rich with many interesting cultural
              monuments, beautiful and diverse nature, forests, lakes, mineral

              Kvemo Kartli is a region with ancient history. The region has kept
              the traces of each stage of human life. People lived here, even 1
              800,000 years ago. The first Europeans were discovered in Dmanisi,
              whose names were Zezva and Mzia. The world knows them as the
              species, Georgian people (Homo Georgicus). The territory of Kvemo
              Kartli has been settled by Kartvelian tribes since ancient times.
              Georgian people were originated as a result of their long
              interaction and interconnections. The most known Kartvelian tribe
              from those times is Gougars or Gogars. The various state units
              were set up at different stages with the development of the
              region. In the VII-XI centuries, the Emirate of Tbilisi, Kldekari
              Saeristavo and Tarish-Dzorageti kingdom were established on the
              area of Kvemo Kartli. There were border Saeristaos( a territorial
              unit of Georgia, usually called a Duchy) of Gaga and Lori in the
              XII-XIII centuries. After the Mongol invasion, Georgia lost its
              Khunan Saeristao and the state border was moved to the
              Ksia-Mtkvari border. The settlement of nomadic Turkmen tribes
              began in the 15th century. During the same period, the nobles were
              created in Kvemo Kartli: Sabaratiano, Saorbeliano etc. In the 17th
              century, Shah Abbas settled a nomadic tribe of Borchalo in the
              Debed Valley and he set up the Lori Khanate. In the XVIII century,
              due to the invasion of the Leki feudal lords, Kvemo Kartli got
              gradually empty from the indigenous population, most of them were
              sacrificed to the enemy, and part of it escaped to other parts of
              Georgia. Their place was occupied by different tribes. This is the
              reason why the ethnicity of this region is diverse. Kvemo Kartli
              was one of the hearth of spreading Christianity in Georgia. This
              explains plenty of churches and monasteries in this area. Summer
              residences of Georgian kings were also located here.

              - is a region in southern Georgia and covers the territories of
              Samtskhe-Javakheti and Tori historical-geographical provinces.
              Akhaltsikhe is the administrative center. The region has a
              distinctive geographical location which contributes its economic
              and cultural relations with neighboring states for centuries.

              Samtskhe-Javakheti is part of historic Meskheti. Meskheti is a
              general name for historic Southwest Georgia. The ancient
              historical Meskheti included the upper part of the Mtkvari valley
              (Samtskhe, Javakheti, Kola, Artaani, Erusheti) and the whole
              Chorokhi valley (Clarjeti, Shavsheti, Tao, Speri, Lazeti, Nigali,
              Asisfori, Tortumi, Basiani). Adjara and Guria were part of
              Meskheti for some time. The big part of the historical Meskheti
              territory is considered as the Turkish Republic. The name of
              Samtskhe comes from the name of the southern Georgian tribe, the
              Meskhetians (Meskhi-Sameske-Samtskhe). Its ancient centers are
              Odzrkhe and Atskuri. Samtskhe was conquered by Turkey in the
              second half of the 16th century. In 1828-29, part of Samtskhe
              returned to Georgia, but the territories of Kveliskhevi,
              Tsurtskabi, Potskhovi and Jakistskali is still within Turkey area.
              Javakheti was firstly mentioned as a conquered region in the
              inscription “Argishti I’’ of the King of Urartu. From ancient
              times Javakheti was one of the Saeristao of the Kingdom of Kartli.
              In the 16th century, Javakheti was occupied by the Ottomans along
              with other parts of southern Georgia. During this period, part of
              the Georgian population moved to the inner regions of Georgia -
              Kartli and Imereti. People who didn’t leave the area, were forced
              to convert to Islam. In the first half of the 19th century, the
              Russian people and the Armenian population from Turkey settled in
              Javakheti. Samtskhe-Javakheti is still an ethnically diverse
              region.

            <li>
              Samtskhe-Javakheti is one of the distinguished regions of Georgia
              with cultural diversity. There are many public holidays here
              (Shotaoba, Vardziaoba, Safaroba, Berikaona, Berobana, Shuamtoba,
              Jivanoba, etc.), which are associated with the names of famous
              people and local traditions. The Meskhetian cuisine is different
              and individual. Except traditional breads, such as Lavashi and
              Shoti, they bake Somini, Kakala, Ukhas, Bazlama bread. Meskheti
              Churchkhela( traditional Georgian sweets) is also different.
              Meskhetians use mulberry Bakmazi( mulberry cream) instead of
              Tatara(grape juice with flour). They also make mulberry
              Tklapi(dried fruits). Without mulberry Tklapi there are no
              weddings and celebrations in Meskheti. Farming is very popular
              here, that’s why their cuisine is rich with milk products and meat
              dishes. The most delicious of Meskhetian cuisine is Tenili cheese.
              It is a cream cheese kept in a pot. It has a gentle consistency
              and a very pleasant creamy aroma. Samtskhe-Javakheti is the only
              place in Georgia where snails are eaten. Georgia is considered a
              wine homeland. Meskheti should also be distinguished in terms of
              winemaking. It is one of the highest viticultural regions not only
              in Georgia but in the whole world. The vine here is 900-1700
              meters above sea level. There is not much information about the
              clothes of Meskheti. As it is known, Meskhetian clothes changed
              according to the epochs. It was greatly influenced by Ottoman and
              Armenian culture. The Georgian ethnographer, Sergi Makalatia,
              describes the low-class Meskhetian woman's dress as: "The women
              wore a skirt with lap, inside a dress, a red shirt with silver
              buttons. They wore a" Zubun "shirt. The women wore long trousers
              with embroidered trousers with colored strings. Meskheti women
              wore a cover in front of dress which was called "Petemali". There
              isonly one copy of a woman dresses in the historical museum of
              Samtskhe-Javakheti. It is nineteenth century ceremonial dress,
              which belonged to a noble woman.

              <span class="strong">Shida Kartli</span>
              - is the historical-geographic region of Georgia. It is situated
              in eastern Georgia, in the central part of the historical Kartli
              region. The old name of Shida Kartli is Zena village. The region
              is quite rich with important cultural monuments and wonderful
              nature. Shida Kartli is a region with ancient history. The area
              was inhabited from the Early Bronze Age. The vast fields, valleys
              and waterfalls, endowed with thousands of flowers are so much
              impressive.
            </li>

            <li>
              The oldest trace of human life in Shida Kartli was found between
              the Lamiskana River, the Kavtura and Tedzami rivers, where
              paleolithic tools were discovered. The area was already quite
              populated during the Bronze Age (III millennium BC). In the early
              Bronze Age, the original version of the "Mtkvari-Arax" culture was
              formed here. The most extensive territorial-administrative unit in
              Georgia, Khevi was formed in the late Bronze Early Iron age. This
              is a system of housing hills, one of them promotes and assumes the
              role of the economic and political center. Several state
              formations were established in eastern Georgia by the Antic
              period. When Parnavaz expanded his authority over the whole of
              Kartli and Egris was joined to the region. Shida Kartli was
              converted into one administrative unit and the Spaspeti (army
              chief) became the head of it. The discovery of numerous coins in
              the Shida Kartli territory is the proof that Iberia had intense
              trade-economic relationship with the other side of the world. In
              the first century BC, Rome's commander, Pompeius conquered in
              Kartli. In the I-III centuries, the kingdom of Iberia was further
              strengthened. Feudal relations have been established since the 4th
              century in the ancient Kartli state. This process was contributed
              by the proclamation of Christianity as a state religion in Kartli
              in the 1930s. The anonymous Armenian geography of the 7th century,
              which mainly reflects the situation of the IV-V centuries,
              presents Kartli again divided into Khevi (ravine) and there are
              the following names ravines in Shida Kartli (Zena village):
              Tuniskhevi (Taniskhevi), Dvani, Achabetiskhevi, Gverdisdziri,
              Sackhumeti, Ksnis Khevi, Ckhradzma, Bazaleti. The whole Shida
              Kartli was united by Vakhtang Gorgasali as one administrative unit
              in the fifth century. In the 7th century, Georgia was conquered by
              the Arabs and the whole burden of Arab domination was on the inner
              regions of Kartli. By the period of David the Builder Georgia was
              united as a monarchy. Shida Kartli was leading the economic and
              cultural life of the country. Cultural life developed in the
              medieval centuries like secular literature, philosophical
              thinking, carpentry, monumental painting, stamping, manuscript
              artwork and stone carving. In the XVII-XVIII centuries the
              northwestern part of Shida Kartli was called Upper Kartli. From
              the first quarter of the XVII century, after the Ottoman conquest
              of Samtskhe-Saatabago, the historical Upper Kartli was separated
              from the Kartli kingdom and the name removed to the northwestern
              part of Shida Kartli. Currently, the northern part of historic
              Shida Kartli is included in the South Ossetian Autonomous District
              and the Dusheti Municipality. Shida Kartli region includes the
              municipalities of Gori, Kaspi, Kareli and Khashuri right now.

              Ertso-Tianeti includes the upper side of River Ivri (Tianeti
              district). Ertso-Tianeti was administratively part of the Kingdom
              of Kakheti. Due to its favorable geographical location,
              Ertsan-Tianeti had great strategic and economic importance. Also,
              one of the branches of trade route passed here, which was the
              connection between the former feudal state of Kartli to Albania
              (Caucasus) and Armenia. In the 13th century, Mongols invaded
              Ertso-Tianeti several times. In the 15th century, after the
              political collapse of the feudal state of united Georgia,
              Ertso-Tianeti became one of the Samouravo (The part of national
              feudal domain) of Kakheti kingdom. The economic interests of
              Pshav-Khevsureti population were mainly related to Ertso-Tianeti,
              that’s why it is mostly inhabited by mountainous Georgians. With
              modern administrative-territorial divisions, Ertso-Tianeti is
              included in Tianeti region of Mtskheta-Mtianeti region. The
              territory of Tianeti municipality is medium high-mountain. Most of
              the territory is occupied by highlands and foothills. The main
              river is the Tianeti River with the Iori River and its numerous
              tributaries. The Sioni water reservoir is also located here.
              Several small lakes are also found. The most important is the
              Grdzelvelebi Lake. This region is rich in cultural monuments:
